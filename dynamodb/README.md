# Visual Studio .Net Dynamo DB

## Tools

[VStudio Tools and SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/)

### I used the samples in the following.  The Query code shows looking up all the keys for a partition, which was the pasis for the Configuration example code I wrote that reads all the keys for a project.

[.Net Code Samples](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/CodeSamples.DotNet.html)

This page has links to Sample which are found in the "Working with DynamoDB" section of the Left-Nav menu.  Each topic under that section has some sample code in Java and .Net.
